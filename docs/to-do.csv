Automate pushing new data to Carto table on Django Asset/Location saves,
Find and geocode ~164 ungeocoded assets,
Delist locations/assets outside of Allegheny County,
Automate publication of DB dump to WPRDC data portal,Done
Standardize addresses with Geomancer + Addressing Dataset + Landmarks (also include parcel ID + address_id in output),

Consider using OpenStreetMap tags for inspiration: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Category:Tag_descriptions,
Modify map to distinguish/highlight multiple assets at the same location,
Add a new map dot color for multi-type Assets (maybe to handle the 1500-Asset location),
Implement solution to float precision issues on geocoordinates (probably switch to Decimal type),
Design re-geocoding interface and worflow,
Fix ~3500 assets geocoded by Pelias with centroids,Done
"Research taxonomies (e.g., https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/downloadables/downloadables.html)",
Mine https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/ for assets,
Use Geomancer Prime to add parcel IDs to assets (for subsequent by-parcel clustering and deduplication),
Assign and actually use parent locations,(Assignment has been tested)
Devise a way to check if Assets are being linked to by the Asset Explorer before allowing them to be deleted,
Delete orphaned Location/Organization/other-non-Asset instances,
Write upsert-capable loader,
Identify other asset types we'd like to include,
"Standardize Location.name fields (eliminating, for instance, trailing spaces)",
"Rename all 'None, None None None' Locations",
Import 8 multitype assets excluded from v1 so far (plus 3 hotels with synthesized_key conflicts),
The Location model is another table that we need an update strategy for (the Django loader may change the Location data after every update),Semi-resolved (by ensuring that the loader only fill in gaps)
Add a 'definition' field to Tags to eventually provide clarifying hovertext (possibly list all Assets at that Location),
"Add synthesized keys for user-edited assets (~'frontend::<Django record ID>')",
Improve map view for admin Location editor (streets + better resolution),
Write API endpoint for streaming a CSV file of assets (for both internal use and feeding an ETL job),Done (modulo workaround for timeouts)
