# Asset Map

This map is very much a work in progress, and is designed to help people implement asset-based community outreach strategies for the 2020 Census. We’re starting by assembling as much data about community assets as we can from local, state, and federal data sources that we’re able to access. Over the next few months, we’ll add additional data sources, clean and code some of the existing data, and add new features to the tool. We’ll provide regular updates in our road map document.

We’ll also learn more about additional asset mapping efforts happening in our region, and we’ll also will engage people in many different communities to learn more about what they consider to be assets, and how they might use this tool to tell an asset-based story about their neighborhood. We’ll also spend some time trying to figure-out how we can continue to keep the information behind the map up to date in the most-efficient way possible, and develop a strategy for how we can financially sustain this work.

If you have any suggestions or feedback, we’d love to hear from you. Please drop us a line at [wprdc@pitt.edu](wprdc@pitt.edu).
