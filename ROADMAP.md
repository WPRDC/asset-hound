# Roadmap for the WPRDC Asset Map 

1. Collect the first round of data.
2. Transform the asset data into a standard schema.
3. Create and deploy an interactive map of the asset data.
4. Add new assets and devise an update procedure.
5. Improve data quality.
    * Associate a parcel ID with every physical asset. Then, automatically check that the geocoordinates of assets are within the boundaries of their parcels.
    * Add tags to improve granularity of data (e.g., correctly classifying restaurants as coffee shops and categorizing places of worship by denomination).
